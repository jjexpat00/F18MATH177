## Preface

This project's original intent was to utilize [LP Assistant](https://www2.bc.edu/gerard-keough/software.html) and implement a new GUI method to apply user-selected choices in the Branch and Bound (BnB) algorithm for integer optimization. The University of Bilkent has a great resource to learn more, found [here](https://www.ie.bilkent.edu.tr/~mustafap/courses/bb.pdf).

Unfortunately, due to time constraints and difficulty in understanding the source of LP Assistant, I find it impossible to develop my original idea. We all face great challenges in life and it is critical to only take on those that are realistic given certain constraints. Instead I will transition to programmatically working through a famous case utilizing the BnB algorithm: the Knapsack Problem!

## Final Thoughts

Should you take a linear optimization class? Definitely.

In Math 177, I learned quite _a lot_ about the many tools found in the realm of linear optimization as well as many of their practical applications. Despite the coursework being objectively difficult, I really enjoyed the class' nature of being problem driven rather than via theory. Being a CS major, I definitely had my fair share of math classes where the instructor would curveball one theory after the other, not giving much time to breath and recognize we were being thrown fastballs the entire time. I can't imagine what a math major goes through - major props.

The applications before and beyond the BnB algorithm have significant relevance to everyday topics. I am surprised these concepts are not exposed earlier on in general math curricula. Want to know the most cost effective way to produce a car? How much can I afford to adjust my sale price to remain competitive with my competitor's pricing? You ever heard of "Game Theory"? Albeit massive oversimplifications of complex concepts, you get the point.

Once you are able to grasp the fundamental aspects, everything layers in perfectly like a lasagna. Each iteration of problems you receive require the whole slice of thought - you can't simply omit concepts because you learned them two months ago. Like algebra in grade school, it takes a deep understanding of the basics to be able to solve increasingly complex problems. It definitely has a rewarding feeling once you accomplish that.
